  1) Test Cases MCDC_Example:

     Tools->MC/DC->View Equivalence Matrices
     Build the test cases accordingly.
     For example:

     a) PairA_2_6:

     	MCDC_Example:
     	a = 1,0
     	b = 1,1
     	c = 0,0
     	return == 1,0

     b) PairB_2_4:

     	MCDC_Example:
     	a = 1,1
     	b = 1,0
     	c = 0,0
     	return == 1,0

     c) PairC_3_4:

     	MCDC_Example:
     	a = 1,1
     	b = 1,1
     	c = 1,0
     	return == 1,0


  2) Test Cases LogicalInAssignment_Example:

     a) LogicalInAssignment_Example.001:
     		
	LogicalInAssignment_Example:
	a = 1, b = 1, c = 1
	return == 1

	Tools->Options->Coverage:
     	Instrument logical operations in assignment statements

	Show difference in code coverage if this option is on.

     b) Complete:
     		
	LogicalInAssignment_Example:
	a = 1,1,1,0
	b = 1,1,0,0
	c = 1,0,0,0
	return == 1,0,0,0

	100% MC/DC can't be achieved.
	Show coverage by analysis (CBA).


  3) Test Cases LogicalFunctionCall_Example:

     a) LogicalFunctionCall_Example.001:

     	Stubbed:
	foo:
	x == 1
	return = 1

     	LogicalFunctionCall_Example:
	a = 1, b = 1, c = 1
	return == 1

	Tools->Options->Coverage:
     	Instrument logical operations in function calls

	Show difference in code coverage if this option is on.

     b) Complete:

     	Stubbed:
	foo:
	x == 1,0,0,0
	return = 1,0,0,0

	Otions->Return Data List Options:
	Multi-return spans range iterations

     	LogicalFunctionCall_Example:
	a = 1,1,1,0
	b = 1,1,0,0
	c = 1,0,0,0
	return == 1,0,0,0


  4) Test Cases LargeCondition1:

     a) Combinatorial:

     	LargeCondition1:
     	a = 1,0, b = 1,0, ... i = 1,0

     	Options: Combination Testing

     	Waste: 2^9 = 512 tests.

     b) Tools->Options->Coverage->MC/DC:
     	Maximum subconditions in MC/DC table pre-calculations: 8, then 9.
     
	Insert MC/DC Test Cases: 18
     	Fails with 8 because 8 is too low.

     c) LargeCondition1.001 - LargeCondition1.010:

     	LargeCondition.001:

     	LargeCondition1:
     	a = 1, b = 1, ... i = 1
	return == 1

     	LargeCondition.002 ... LargeCondition.010:

	LargeCondtion1:
     	i = 0, remainder the same as LargeCondition.001
	return == 0

	Similar for the other test cases. 10 tests altogether.


  5) Test Cases LargeCondition2:

     a) Combinatorial:

     	LargeCondition2:
     	a = 1,0, b = 1,0, ... i = 1,0

     	Options: Combination Testing

     	Waste: 2^9 = 512 tests.

     b) Tools->Options->Coverage->MC/DC:
     	Maximum subconditions in MC/DC table pre-calculations: 8
     
	Insert MC/DC Test Cases: 16

     c) Combinatorial_||, Combinatorial_F_I, Combinatorial_F_H, Combinatorial_F_FG, Combinatorial_F_C:

     	Combinatorial_||:

     	LargeCondition2:
     	a = 1,0 b = 1,0, c = 0, d = 1,0, e = 1,0, f = 1, g = 0, h = 1, i = 1
	return == 1

     	Combinatorial_F_I:

	LargeCondition2:
     	i = 0, remainder the same as Combinatorial_||
	return == 0

	Similar for the other test cases. 20 tests altogether.
