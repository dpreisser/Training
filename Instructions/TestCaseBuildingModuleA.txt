  1) Test Cases Place_Order:

     a) MyTest:

	Stubbed:
      	Update_Table_Record:
      	Table == 1, check_total == 10.0.

      	Place_Order:
      	Table = 1, Seat = 0
	Order.Entree = Chicken

      	Show out of range with Order.entree = 5.

      	Purpose: First Unit Test for Place_Order.

     	Stubbed:
      	Update_Table_Record:
      	Table == 1, ckeck_total == 0.0,14.0,10.0,18.0,12.0,0.0

      	Place_Order:
      	Table = 1, Seat = 0
	Order.Entree = NO_ENTREE..5/1

      	Purpose: Code coverage of Place_Order.

     c) Cov_Place_Dessert:

     	Stubbed:
      	Update_Table_Record:
      	Table == 1, ckeck_total == 0.0,14.0,10.0,18.0,12.0,0.0

      	Place_Order:
