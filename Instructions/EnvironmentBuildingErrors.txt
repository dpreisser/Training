     1) Test Cases InitializeRecord:

        a) InitializeRecord.001

       	   IntitializeRecord:
       	   StudentName = Tom, StudentId = 20
       	   return.field1 == Tom, return.field2 == 20

       	   Test->Scripting->Export Script

    	b) InitializeRecord.002:

       	   changes_new.c -> changes.c:
	   StudentName -> Param1, StudentId -> Param2
       	   Environment->Rebuild Environment

       	   Test->Scripting->Import Script

       	   Notice: Test Cases are marked as failed.
       	   Tools->Options->Execute: Strict test case importing

       	   Delete InitializeRecord.002.

       	   Adjust InitializeRecord_001.tst:

       	   Param1 = Tom, Param2 = 20
       	   return.field1 == Tom, return.field2 == 20

       	   Test->Scripting->Import Script
