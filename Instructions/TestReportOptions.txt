      Notes:

      Test Case Data: Only dependent on test case selection.
      Execution Results: Only dependent on test case selection.

      For metrics to appear only for the selected (ticked) test cases:
      - Untick "Allways use all results in reports" (Test->View).
      - Tick only the test cases you want to appear in metrics.

      Coverage only appears for the slected (ticked) test cases.
      "Allways use all results in reports" doesn't have any influence.

      Testcase Management can not be influenced.
