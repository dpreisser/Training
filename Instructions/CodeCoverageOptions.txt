Excercise Code Coverage Options

  A) Environment:
     DATE_UTILITIES_W

     UUT:
     date.c utilities.c (SourceFiles/CodeCoverageOptions)

     Coverage:
     Statement+Branch

     UUTs & Stubs->Stub dependencies:
     All


     1) Test Cases DateString:

     	a) DateString.001:

     	   Tools->Options->Coverage->Coverage I/O type:
     	   Animation

     	   DateString:
     	   theYear = 2016, theMonth = 4, theDay = 1
     	   return == April \,1 2016

     	   Execute
     	   Activate Coverage Animation

     	   Tools->Options->Report->Filter Metrics Report:
     	   Demonstrate different Filter Metrics Report Options.


     2) Test Cases ConcatenateStrings:

     	a) ConcatenateStrings.001:

	   It's all about TRACE.

     	   Tools->Options->Builder:
     	   Test all non]member inline functions

     	   Tools->Options->Coverage:
     	   Provide code coverage in header files

     	   ConcatenateStrings:
     	   str1 = a, str2 = bc
     	   return == abc

     	   Look at Metric Report.

     	   Tools->Options->Coverage:
     	   Show inlines as covered in all units
     	   Coverage->Initialize->Statement+Branch

     	   Look at Metric Report again.


     3) Test Cases MaxDays:

       a) Incomplete1:

       	  MaxDays:
     	  theYear = 2015,2000,(2)2016, theMonth = 2(2),1,4
     	  return 28,29,31,30

     	  View Coverage

     	  Tools->Options->Coverage:
     	  Instrument logical operations in assignment statements
	  Coverage->Initialize->Statement+Branch

     	  View Coverage

       b) Incomplete2:

       	  MaxDays:
       	  theYear = 2015,2000,(3)2016, theMonth = 3(2),1,4
       	  return 28,(2)29,31,30

       	  View Coverage

       	  Tools->Options->Coverage
       	  Instrument implictit default case for switch-case blocks
       	  Coverage->Initialize->Statement+Branch

       	  View Coverage

       c) Complete

       	  MaxDays:
     	  theYear = 2015,2000,(4)2016, theMonth = 3(2),1,4,0
     	  return 28,(2)29,31,30,1
